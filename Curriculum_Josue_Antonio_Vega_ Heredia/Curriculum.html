                    I'm a full stack web developer who can build apps from the ground up. I've worked mostly at startups so I am used to
                    wearing many hats. I am a very product focused developer who prioritizes user feedback first and foremost. I'm
                    generally very flexible when investigating new roles.

                <h4>May 2020- current</h4>
                <p><b>Senior Javascript Developer</b> at Tokenized</p>

                <p>Melbourne</p>
                <p>
                    Tokenized is a Bitcoin wallet for issuing, managing and trading digital tokens. I built out the front end which was
                    packaged as an electron app. It was a difficult frontend to build because we store the users keys locally and used them
                    to sign transactions and contracts.

                <h4>Mar 2018 - Jan 2020</h4>
                <p><b>Senior Javascript Developer</b> at Blockbid</p>

                <p>Melbourne</p>
                <p>
                    Blockbid is an Australian crypto currency exchange. I started off on the frontend but eventually became lead tech and
                    worked on every moving piece of the exchange. I really enjoyed working with liquidity providers and connecting their
                    platforms to help us achieve liquid markets.

                    <li>Docker / Heroku / GCP</li>

                <h4>Jan 2016 - Jan 2018</h4>
                <p><b>Developer </b> at Listium</p>

                <p>
                    Built a very large and complex React / Redux application. It works on all platforms and has IOS/Android builds due to it
                    being a PWA. (wrapped it in React Native though only implementing a WebView)

                    <li>Worked with Postgres, Redis and Dynamodb for storage.</li>

                    “Thomas was hired as a lead developer and, upon the leaving of our co-founder took over as CTO of Earbits.
                    Thomas is, hands down, one of those A Players you hear of companies dying to hire. He is incredibly smart, not just
                    at code but about everything from classical music to Chinese language and culture. Thomas is great to work with
                    and, as a well established contributor to open source projects and several successful ventures, commands the
                    respect of engineers at all levels. I would suggest doing anything you can to have him on your team.” <br>

                    Two years ago our CTO left on a moment's notice, Thomas saved our company by quickly stepping up to fill this role.
                    He has been with our company through thick and thin and made serious personal sacrifices in order to help the
                    company during tough times. He is a phenomenal hacker and a true team player. Highly recommended!” <br>

                    leader in the front-end community via backbonetutorials.com and cdnjs.com, to designing and implementing the API
                    for cdnjs.com, working with Thomas has been fantastic learning experience. Thomas is truly a full stack develop, and
                    his work output is incredible. If there is any opportunity to work with Thomas, I take it. He is the definition of an A
                    player.” <br>
